# ChatBud

## ❓ What is ChatBud?

ChatBud is a web app that gamifies talking to random strangers on the internet (with hints!) to encourage and teach socially anxious people how to talk to others.

## 👑 Features

ChatBud allows users to:

- Sign in and authenticate themselves using their phone numbers.
- Fill out a very brief form collecting user's names, years of birth, and interests.
- Match with each other, assuming they have similar interests.
- Talk to whoever the user matches, providing friendly suggestions along the way.
- Grow and nurture their plant through their conversations!
